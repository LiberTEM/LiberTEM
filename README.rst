LiberTEM is an open source platform for pixelated scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).

LiberTEM is in the early stages, so if you like to influence the direction this
project is taking, or if you want to contribute, please join our `gitter chat <https://gitter.im/LiberTEM/Lobby>`_,
our `development mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/libertem-dev>`_,
and our `general mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/libertem>`_. 

As a first application, we are targeting anything that can be implemented by applying masks to each detector frame,
for example the numerous virtual detector methods (virtual bright field, virtual HAADF, ...) or center of mass.
There are example jupyter notebooks available in the `examples directory <https://github.com/LiberTEM/LiberTEM/blob/master/examples>`_.
If you are having trouble running the examples, please let us know, either by filing an issue
or by `joining our Gitter chat <https://gitter.im/LiberTEM/Lobby>`_.

Please also join the discussion on `our issue tracker <https://github.com/liberTEM/LiberTEM/issues/>`_.
