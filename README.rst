LiberTEM is an open source platform for high-throughput distributed processing
of large-scale binary data sets using a simplified `MapReduce programming model
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce>`_. The current focus is `pixelated
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_transmission_electron_microscopy#Universal_detectors_(4D_STEM)>`_
scanning transmission electron microscopy (`STEM
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_transmission_electron_microscopy>`_)
:cite:`doi:10.1002/9783527808465.EMC2016.6284,Ophus_2019` and scanning electron beam
diffraction data.

It is `designed for high throughput and scalability
<https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM/architecture.html>`_ on PCs, single server
nodes, clusters and cloud services. On clusters it can use fast distributed
local storage on high-performance SSDs. That way it achieves `very high
aggregate IO performance
<https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM/performance.html>`_ on a compact and
cost-efficient system built from stock components. All CPU cores and CUDA devices in
a system can be used in parallel.

LiberTEM is supported on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. Other platforms that allow
installation of Python 3 and the required packages will likely work as well. The
GUI is running in a web browser.

Installation
------------

The short version:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ virtualenv -p python3 ~/libertem-venv/
    $ source ~/libertem-venv/bin/activate
    (libertem) $ pip install "libertem[torch]"

    # optional for GPU support
    (libertem) $ pip install cupy

Please see `our documentation <https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM/install.html>`_ for details!

Deployment as a single-node system for a local user is thoroughly tested and can
be considered stable. Deployment on a cluster is experimental and still requires
some additional work, see `Issue #105
<https://github.com/LiberTEM/LiberTEM/issues/105>`_.

Applications
------------

- Virtual detectors (virtual bright field, virtual HAADF, center of mass :cite:`Krajnak2016`,
  custom shapes via masks)
- `Analysis of amorphous materials <https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM/app/amorphous.html>`_
- `Strain mapping <https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM-blobfinder/>`_
- `Custom analysis functions (user-defined functions) <https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM/udf.html>`_
- `Off-axis electron holography reconstruction <https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM/app/holography.html>`_

Please see `the applications section <https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM/applications.html>`_ of our documentation for details!

The Python API and user-defined functions (UDFs) can be used for more complex
operations with arbitrary masks and other features like data export. There are
example Jupyter notebooks available in the `examples directory
<https://github.com/LiberTEM/LiberTEM/tree/master/examples>`_. If you are having
trouble running the examples, please let us know, either by filing an issue or
by `joining our Gitter chat <https://gitter.im/LiberTEM/Lobby>`_.

LiberTEM is suitable as a high-performance processing backend for other
applications, including live data streams. `Contact us
<https://gitter.im/LiberTEM/Lobby>`_ if you are interested!

LiberTEM is evolving rapidly and prioritizes features following user demand and
contributions. In the future we'd like to implement live acquisition, and more
analysis methods for all applications of pixelated STEM and other large-scale
detector data. If you like to influence the direction this project is taking, or
if you'd like to `contribute
<https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM/contributing.html>`_, please join our
`gitter chat <https://gitter.im/LiberTEM/Lobby>`_ and our `general mailing list
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/libertem>`_.

File formats
------------

LiberTEM currently opens most file formats used for pixelated STEM. See `our
general information on loading data
<https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM/formats.html>`_ and `format-specific
documentation
<https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM/reference/dataset.html#formats>`_ for more
