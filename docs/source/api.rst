.. _`api documentation`:

Python API
==========

The Python API is a concise API for using LiberTEM from Python code. It is suitable both
for interactive scripting, for example from Jupyter notebooks, and for usage
from within a Python application or script.

.. _`context`:

Context
-------

The :class:`libertem.api.Context` object is the entry-point for most interaction
and processing with LiberTEM. It is used to load datasets, specify and run analyses.
The following snippet initializes a :class:`~libertem.api.Context` ready-for-use
with default parameters and backing.

.. code-block:: python

    import libertem.api as lt

    ctx = lt.Context()

See the :class:`API documentation <libertem.api.Context>` for the full capabilities
exposed by the :class:`~libertem.api.Context`.


Basic example
-------------

This is a basic example to load the API, create a local cluster, load a file and
run an analysis. For complete examples on how to use the Python API, please see the
Jupyter notebooks in `the example directory
<https://github.com/LiberTEM/LiberTEM/tree/master/examples>`_.

For more details, please see :ref:`loading data`, :ref:`dataset api` and
:ref:`format-specific reference<formats>`. See :ref:`sample data` for publicly available datasets.

.. include:: /../../examples/basic.py
    :code:

Custom processing routines
--------------------------

To go beyond the included capabilities of LiberTEM, you can implement your own
using :ref:`user-defined functions`.

Reference
---------

For a full reference, please see :ref:`reference`.

.. _`executors`:

Executors
---------

.. versionadded:: 0.9.0
    The executor API is internal. Since choice and parameters of executors
    are important for integration with Dask and other frameworks,
    they are now documented. Only the names and creation methods for
    executors are reasonably stable. The rest of the API is subject to
    change without notice. For that reason it is documented in the developer
    section and not in the API reference.

The default executor is :class:`~libertem.executor.dask.DaskJobExecutor` that
uses the :code:`dask.distributed` scheduler. To support all LiberTEM features and
achieve optimal performance, the methods provided by LiberTEM to start a
:code:`dask.distributed` cluster should be used. However, LiberTEM can also run on a
"vanilla" :code:`dask.distributed` cluster. Please note that :code:`dask.distributed`
clusters that are not created by LiberTEM might use threading or a mixture of threads
and processes, and therefore might behave or perform differently to a
LiberTEM-instantiated cluster.

The :class:`~libertem.executor.inline.InlineJobExecutor` runs all tasks
synchronously in the current thread. This is useful for debugging and for
special applications such as running UDFs that perform their own multithreading
efficiently or for other non-standard use that requires tasks to be executed
sequentially and in order.

See also :ref:`threading` for more information on multithreading in UDFs.

.. versionadded:: 0.9.0

The :class:`~libertem.executor.concurrent.ConcurrentJobExecutor` runs all tasks
using :mod:`python:concurrent.futures`. Using a
:class:`python:concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`, which is the deafult behaviour,
allows sharing large amounts of data as well as other resources between the
main thread and workers efficiently, but is severely slowed down by the
Python `global interpreter lock <https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock>`_
under many circumstances. Furthermore, it can create thread safety issues such as
https://github.com/LiberTEM/LiberTEM-blobfinder/issues/35.

It is also in principle possible to use a :class:`python:concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`
as backing for the :class:`~libertem.executor.concurrent.ConcurrentJobExecutor`,
though this is untested and is likely to lead to worse performance than the
LiberTEM default :class:`~libertem.executor.dask.DaskJobExecutor`.

For special applications, the
:class:`~libertem.executor.delayed.DelayedJobExecutor` can use `dask.delayed
<https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/delayed.html>`_ to delay the processing. This
is experimental, see :ref:`dask` for more details. It might use threading as
well, depending on the Dask scheduler that is used by :code:`compute()`.


Common executor choices
.......................

.. versionadded:: 0.9.0

:meth:`libertem.api.Context.make_with` provides a convenient shortcut to start a
:class:`~libertem.api.Context` with common executor choices. See the
:meth:`API documentation <libertem.api.Context.make_with>`
for available options!

Connect to a cluster
....................

See :ref:`cluster` on how to start a scheduler and workers.

.. Not run with docs-check since it doesn't play well with launching a multiprocessing
   cluster

.. code-block:: python

    from libertem import api
    from libertem.executor.dask import DaskJobExecutor

    # Connect to a Dask.Distributed scheduler at 'tcp://localhost:8786'
    with DaskJobExecutor.connect('tcp://localhost:8786') as executor:
        ctx = api.Context(executor=executor)
        ...

.. _`cluster spec`:

Customize CPUs and CUDA devices
...............................

To control how many CPUs and which CUDA devices are used, you can specify them as follows:

.. Not run with docs-check since it doesn't play well with launching a multiprocessing
   cluster

.. code-block:: python

    from libertem import api
    from libertem.executor.dask import DaskJobExecutor, cluster_spec
    from libertem.utils.devices import detect

    # Find out what would be used, if you like
    # returns dictionary with keys "cpus" and "cudas", each with a list of device ids
    devices = detect()

    # Example: Deactivate CUDA devices by removing them from the device dictionary
    devices['cudas'] = []

    # Example: Deactivate CuPy integration
    devices['has_cupy'] = False

    # Example: Use 3 CPUs. The IDs are ignored at the moment, i.e. no CPU pinning
    devices['cpus'] = range(3)

    # Generate a spec for a Dask.distributed SpecCluster
    # Relevant kwargs match the dictionary entries
    spec = cluster_spec(**devices)
    # Start a local cluster with the custom spec
    with DaskJobExecutor.make_local(spec=spec) as executor:
        ctx = api.Context(executor=executor)
        ...

Please see :ref:`dask executor` for a reference of the Dask-based executor.


.. _`pipelined`:

Pipelined executor
------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.10.0

For live data processing, the :class:`~libertem.executor.pipelined.PipelinedExecutor`
provides a multiprocessing executor that routes the live data source in a round-robin
fashion to worker processes. This is important to support processing that cannot keep
up with the detector speed on a single CPU core. This executor also works for offline
data sets in principle, but is not optimized for that use case.

Similar to the Dask-based executor, it is possible to customize the devices
used for computation:

.. code-block:: python

    from libertem import api
    from libertem.executor.pipelined import PipelinedExecutor
    from libertem.utils.devices import detect

    spec = PipelinedExecutor.make_spec(cpus=[0, 1, 2], cudas=[])
    executor = PipelinedExecutor(
        spec=spec,
        pin_workers=False,  # set to True to keep worker processes pinned to specific CPU cores or CPUs
    )
    ...
    executor.close()

    # you can also use the `detect` function as above:
    spec2 = PipelinedExecutor.make_spec(**detect())

Please see :ref:`pipelined executor` for a reference of the pipelined executor.
