Applications
============

LiberTEM itself is primarily a framework for efficient data access and
compute parallelisation. Through the :ref:`UDF interface<user-defined functions>`,
the user is able to define their own analyses and benefit from the optimisations
that LiberTEM provides on any dataset in a way which scales to any machine.

Some application-specific code developed using LiberTEM has been
spun out as sub-packages that can be installed independent of
LiberTEM core. See :ref:`packages` for the current overview of sub-packages.

A number of standalone applications are provided as example
Jupyter notebooks, available for download from
<`the examples page <https://github.com/LiberTEM/LiberTEM/tree/master/examples>`_>
and also integrated into this documentation via the links below:
