New features
------------

* In addition to tuples, :class:`~libertem.common.shape.Shape` objects can be used as
  :code:`extra_shape` parameter for :meth:`libertem.udf.base.UDF.buffer` and
  :meth:`libertem.udf.base.UDF.aux_data` now. (:pr:`694`)
* Progress bar support based on :code:`tqdm` that can be enabled by passing
  :code:`progress=True` to :meth:`libertem.api.Context.run_udf`,
  :meth:`libertem.api.Context.run` and :meth:`libertem.api.Context.map`: :ref:`progress bar`. (:pr:`613,670,655`)
* Include explicit support for Direct Electron's DE5 format based on HDF5. (:pr:`704`)
* GUI: Downloadable results as HDF5, NPZ, TIFF, and RAW. See
  :ref:`download results` for details. (:pr:`665`)
* :meth:`libertem.api.Context.load` now automatically detects file
  type and parameters if :code:`filetype="auto"` is passed. (:pr:`610,621,734`)
* Relocatable GUI: Allow LiberTEM to run from different URL prefixes, allowing integration into,
  for example, JupyterLab. (:pr:`697`)
* Run :meth:`~libertem.udf.base.UDFPreprocessMixin.preprocess` also before merge on
  the master node to allocate or initialize buffers, in addition to running on the
  workers (:pr:`624`).
* No need to set thread count environment variables anymore since the thread count
  for OpenBLAS, OpenMP, Intel MKL and pyFFTW is now set on the workers at run-time.
  Numba support will be added as soon as Numba 0.49 is released. (:pr:`685`).

Bugfixes
--------

* A large number of usability improvements (:pr:`622,639,641,642,659,666,690,699,700,704`).
  Thanks and credit to many new contributors from GSoC!
* Fixed the buggy "enable Direct I/O" checkbox of the RAW dataset and
  handle unsupported operating systems gracefully. (:pr:`696,659`)


Documentation
-------------

* Added screenshots and description of ROI
  and stddev features in usage docs (:pr:`669`)
* Improved instructions for installing LiberTEM
  (general: :pr:`664`; for development: :pr:`598`)
* Add information for downloading and generating sample
  datasets: :ref:`sample data`. (:pr:`650,670,707`)

Obsolescence
------------

* Parameters :code:`crop_detector_to` and :code:`detector_size_raw` of
  :class:`libertem.io.dataset.raw.RawFileDataSet` are deprecated and will be removed
  after 0.6.0. Please specify :code:`detector_size` instead or use a specialized DataSet, for example for EMPAD.
* :class:`libertem.udf.feature_vector_maker.FeatureVecMakerUDF` is deprecated
  and will be removed in 0.6.0. Use :class:`~libertem.udf.masks.ApplyMasksUDF`
  with a sparse stack of single pixel masks or a stack generated by
  :meth:`libertem_blobfinder.common.patterns.feature_vector` instead.
  (:pr:`618`)

Misc
----

* Clustering analysis
   + Use a connectivity matrix to only cluster neighboring pixels,
     reducing memory footprint while improving speed and quality (:pr:`618`).
   + Use faster :class:`~libertem.udf.masks.ApplyMasksUDF` to generate feature
     vector (:pr:`618`).
* :class:`~libertem.udf.stddev.StdDevUDF`
   + About 10x speed-up for large frames (:pr:`625,640`)
   + Rename result buffers of :class:`~libertem.udf.stddev.StdDevUDF`,
     :meth:`~libertem.udf.stddev.run_stddev` and
     :meth:`~libertem.udf.stddev.consolidate_result` from :code:`'sum_frame'` to
     :code:`'sum'`, :code:`'num_frame'` to :code:`'num_frames'` (:pr:`640`)
   + Resolve ambiguity between variance and sum of variances in result buffer names of
     :class:`~libertem.udf.stddev.StdDevUDF`,
     :meth:`~libertem.udf.stddev.run_stddev` and
     :meth:`~libertem.udf.stddev.consolidate_result`. (:pr:`640`)
* LiberTEM works with Python 3.8 for experimental use. A context using a remote Dask.Distributed cluster
  can lead to lock-ups or errors with Python 3.8. The default local Dask.Distributed context works.
* Improve performance with large tiles. (:pr:`649`)
* :class:`~libertem.udf.sum.SumUDF` moved to the :mod:`libertem.udf` folder (:pr:`613`).
* Make sure the signal dimension of result buffer slices can be
  flattened without creating an implicit copy (:pr:`738`, :issue:`739`)

   :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3674003

This is a bugfix release, mainly constraining the :code:`msgpack` dependency,
as distributed is not compatible to version 1.0 yet. It also contains
important fixes in the HDF5 dataset.

Bugfixes
--------

* Fix HDF5 with automatic tileshape (:pr:`608`)
* Fix reading from HDF5 with roi beyond the first partition (:pr:`606`)
* Add version constraint on msgpack

.. _`v0-4-0`:

0.4.0 / 2020-02-13
##################

.. image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3666686.svg
   :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3666686

The main points of this release are the :ref:`job deprecation` and restructuring
of our packaging, namely :ref:`extracting the blobfinder module <restructuring-0-4>`.

New features
------------

* :code:`dtype` support for UDFs :ref:`udf dtype` (:issue:`549`, :pr:`550`)
* Dismiss error messages via keyboard: allows pressing the escape key to close all currently open error messages (:issue:`437`)
* ROI doesn't have any effect if in pick mode, so we hide the dropdown in that case (:issue:`511`)
* Make tileshape parameter of HDF5 DataSet optional (:pr:`578`)
* Open browser after starting the server. Enabled by default, can be disabled using --no-browser (:issue:`81`, :pr:`580`)
* Implement :class:`libertem.udf.masks.ApplyMasksUDF` as a replacement of ApplyMasksJob (:issue:`549`, :pr:`550`)
* Implement :class:`libertem.udf.raw.PickUDF` as a replacement of PickFrameJob (:issue:`549`, :pr:`550`)
 
Bug fixes
---------

* Fix FRMS6 in a distributed setting. We now make sure to only do I/O in methods that are running on worker nodes (:pr:`531`).
* Fixed loading of nD HDF5 files. Previously the HDF5 DataSet was hardcoded for
  4D data - now, arbitraty dimensions should be supported (:issue:`574`, :pr:`567`)
* Fix :code:`DaskJobExecutor.run_each_host`. Need to pass :code:`pure=False` to ensure multiple runs of the function (:pr:`528`).

Obsolescence
------------

* Because HDFS support is right now not tested (and to my knowledge also not
  used) and the upstream :code:`hdfs3` project is not actively maintained, remove
  support for HDFS. :code:`ClusterDataSet` or :code:`CachedDataSet` should be used
  instead (:issue:`38`, :pr:`534`).

Misc
----

* Depend on distributed>=2.2.0 because of an API change. (:pr:`577`)
* All analyses ported from Job to UDF back-end. The Job-related code remains for now for comparison purposes (:issue:`549`, :pr:`550`)

.. _`job deprecation`:

Job API deprecation
-------------------

The original Job API of LiberTEM is superseded by the new :ref:`user-defined
functions` API with release 0.4.0. See :issue:`549` for a detailed overview
of the changes. The UDF API brings the following advantages:

* Support for regions of interest (ROIs).
* Easier to implement, extend and re-use UDFs compared to Jobs.
* Clean separation between back-end implementation details and application-specific code.
* Facilities to implement non-trivial operations, see :ref:`advanced udf`.
* Performance is at least on par.

For that reason, the Job API has become obsolete. The existing public
interfaces, namely :meth:`libertem.api.Context.create_mask_job` and
:meth:`libertem.api.Context.create_pick_job`, will be supported in LiberTEM for
two more releases after 0.4.0, i.e. including 0.6.0. Using the Job API will
trigger deprecation warnings starting with this release. The new
:class:`~libertem.udf.masks.ApplyMasksUDF` replaces
:class:`~libertem.job.masks.ApplyMasksJob`, and :class:`~libertem.udf.raw.PickUDF`
replaces :class:`~libertem.job.raw.PickFrameJob`.

The Analysis classes that relied on the Job API as a back-end are already ported
to the corresponding UDF back-end. The new back-end may lead to minor
differences in behavior, such as a change of returned dtype. The legacy code for
using a Job back-end will remain until 0.6.0 and can be activated during the
transition period by setting :code:`analysis.TYPE = 'JOB'` before running.

From :class:`~libertem.job.masks.ApplyMasksJob` to :class:`~libertem.udf.masks.ApplyMasksUDF`
.............................................................................................

Main differences:

* :class:`~libertem.udf.masks.ApplyMasksUDF` returns the result with the first
  axes being the dataset's navigation axes. The last dimension is the mask
  index. :class:`~libertem.job.masks.ApplyMasksJob` used to return transposed
  data with flattened navigation dimension.
* Like all UDFs, running an :class:`~libertem.udf.masks.ApplyMasksUDF` returns a
  dictionary. The result data is accessible with key :code:`'intensity'` as a
  :class:`~libertem.common.buffers.BufferWrapper` object.
* ROIs are supported now, like in all UDFs.

.. testsetup:: jobdeprecation

    import numpy as np
    import libertem
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    def all_ones():
        return np.ones((16, 16))

    def single_pixel():
        buf = np.zeros((16, 16))
        buf[7, 7] = 1
        return buf

Previously with :class:`~libertem.job.masks.ApplyMasksJob`:

.. testcode:: jobdeprecation

    # Deprecated!
    mask_job = ctx.create_mask_job(
      factories=[all_ones, single_pixel],
      dataset=dataset
    )
    mask_job_result = ctx.run(mask_job)

    plt.imshow(mask_job_result[0].reshape(dataset.shape.nav))

Now with :class:`~libertem.udf.masks.ApplyMasksUDF`:

.. testcode:: jobdeprecation

    mask_udf = libertem.udf.masks.ApplyMasksUDF(
      mask_factories=[all_ones, single_pixel]
    )
    mask_udf_result = ctx.run_udf(dataset=dataset, udf=mask_udf)

    plt.imshow(mask_udf_result['intensity'].data[..., 0])

From :class:`~libertem.job.raw.PickFrameJob` to :class:`~libertem.udf.raw.PickUDF`
..................................................................................

:class:`~libertem.job.raw.PickFrameJob` allowed to pick arbitrary contiguous
slices in both navigation and signal dimension. In practice, however, it was
mostly used to extract single complete frames.
:class:`~libertem.udf.raw.PickUDF` allows to pick the *complete* signal
dimension from an arbitrary non-contiguous region of interest in navigation
space by specifying a ROI.

If necessary, more complex subsets of a dataset can be extracted by constructing
a suitable subset of an identity matrix for the signal dimension and using it
with ApplyMasksUDF and the appropriate ROI for the navigation dimension.
Alternatively, it is now easily possible to implement a custom UDF for this
purpose. Performing the complete processing through an UDF on the worker nodes
instead of loading the data to the central node may be a viable alternative as
well.

:class:`~libertem.udf.raw.PickUDF` now returns data in the native :code:`dtype`
of the dataset. Previously, :class:`~libertem.job.raw.PickFrameJob` converted to
floats.

Using :meth:`libertem.api.Context.create_pick_analysis` continues to be the
recommended convenience function to pick single frames.

.. _`restructuring-0-4`:

Restructuring into sub-packages
-------------------------------

We are currently restructuring LiberTEM into packages that can be installed and
used independently, see :issue:`261`. This will be a longer process and changes
the import locations.

* `Blobfinder <https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM-blobfinder/>`_ is the first
  module separated in 0.4.0.
* See :ref:`packages` for a current overview of sub-packages.

For a transition period, importing from the previous locations is supported but
will trigger a :code:`FutureWarning`. See :ref:`show warnings` on how to
activate deprecation warning messages, which is strongly recommended while the
restructuring is ongoing.

0.2.0 / 2019-10-07
##################

This release constitutes a major update after almost a year of development.
Systematic change management starts with this release.

This is the `release message <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/libertem/p7MVoVqXOs0/vP_tu6K7CwAJ>`_: 

User-defined functions
----------------------

LiberTEM 0.2 offers a new API to define a wide range of user-defined reduction
functions (UDFs) on distributed data. The interface and implementation offers a
number of unique features:

* Reductions are defined as functions that are executed on subsets of the data.
  That means they are equally suitable for distributed computing, for interactive
  display of results from a progressing calculation, and for handling live data¹.
* Interfaces adapted to both simple and complex use cases: From a simple map()
  functionality to complex multi-stage reductions.
* Rich options to define input and output data for the reduction functions, which
  helps to implement non-trivial operations efficiently within a single pass over
  the input data.
* Composition and extension through object oriented programming
* Interfaces that allow highly efficient processing: locality of reference, cache
  efficiency, memory handling

Introduction: https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM/udf.html

Advanced features: https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM/udf/advanced.html

A big shoutout to Alex (:user:`sk1p`) who developed it! 🏆

¹User-defined functions will work on live data without modification as soon as
LiberTEM implements back-end support for live data, expected in 2020.

Support for 4D STEM applications
--------------------------------

In parallel to the UDF interface, we have implemented a number of applications
that make use of the new facilities:

* Correlation-based peak finding and refinement for CBED (credit: Karina Ruzaeva :user:`kruzaeva`)
* Strain mapping
* Clustering
* Fluctuation EM
* Radial Fourier Series (advanced Fluctuation EM)

More details and examples: https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM/applications.html

Extended documentation
----------------------

We have greatly improved the coverage of our documentation:
https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM/index.html#documentation

Fully automated release pipeline
--------------------------------

Alex (:user:`sk1p`) invested a great deal of effort into fully automating our release
process. From now on, we will be able to release more often, including service
releases. 🚀

Basic dask.distributed array integration
----------------------------------------

LiberTEM can generate efficient dask.distributed arrays from all supported
dataset types with this release. That means it should be possible to use our high-performance file
readers in applications outside of LiberTEM.

File formats
------------

Support for various file formats has improved. More details:
https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM/formats.html

.. _`v0-1-0`:

0.1.0 / 2018-11-06
##################

Initial release of a minimum viable product and proof of concept.

Support for applying masks with high throughput on distributed systems with
interactive web GUI display and scripting capability.
