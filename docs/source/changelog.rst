This release constitutes a major update after almost a year of development.
Systematic change management starts with this release.

This is the `release message <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/libertem/p7MVoVqXOs0/vP_tu6K7CwAJ>`_: 

User-defined functions
----------------------

LiberTEM 0.2 offers a new API to define a wide range of user-defined reduction
functions (UDFs) on distributed data. The interface and implementation offers a
number of unique features:

* Reductions are defined as functions that are executed on subsets of the data.
  That means they are equally suitable for distributed computing, for interactive
  display of results from a progressing calculation, and for handling live data¬π.
* Interfaces adapted to both simple and complex use cases: From a simple map()
  functionality to complex multi-stage reductions.
* Rich options to define input and output data for the reduction functions, which
  helps to implement non-trivial operations efficiently within a single pass over
  the input data.
* Composition and extension through object oriented programming
* Interfaces that allow highly efficient processing: locality of reference, cache
  efficiency, memory handling

Advanced features: https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM/udf/advanced.html

A big shoutout to Alex (:user:`sk1p`) who developed it! üèÜ

¬πUser-defined functions will work on live data without modification as soon as
LiberTEM implements back-end support for live data, expected in 2020.

Support for 4D STEM applications
--------------------------------

In parallel to the UDF interface, we have implemented a number of applications
that make use of the new facilities:

* Correlation-based peak finding and refinement for CBED (credit: Karina Ruzaeva :user:`kruzaeva`)
* Strain mapping
* Clustering
* Fluctuation EM
* Radial Fourier Series (advanced Fluctuation EM)

More details and examples: https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM/applications.html

Extended documentation
----------------------

We have greatly improved the coverage of our documentation:
https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM/index.html#documentation

Fully automated release pipeline
--------------------------------

Alex (:user:`sk1p`) invested a great deal of effort into fully automating our release
process. From now on, we will be able to release more often, including service
releases. üöÄ

Basic dask.distributed array integration
----------------------------------------

LiberTEM can generate efficient dask.distributed arrays from all supported
dataset types with this release. That means it should be possible to use our high-performance file
readers in applications outside of LiberTEM.

File formats
------------

Support for various file formats has improved. More details:
https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM/formats.html

.. _`v0-1-0`:

0.1.0
#####

Initial release of a minimum viable product and proof of concept.

Support for applying masks with high throughput on distributed systems with
interactive web GUI display and scripting capability.
