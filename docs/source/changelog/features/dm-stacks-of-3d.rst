[Feature] Support for loading stacks of 3D DM files
===================================================

* Before, we only supported loading stacks of 2D images, where each image was in its own file. This adds support for the case where there is more than one 2D image per file (as a 3D stack), stacking the images of all files along the Z axis (:pr:`877`)
