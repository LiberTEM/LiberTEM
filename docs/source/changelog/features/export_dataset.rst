[Features] Context.convert_dataset
==================================

* The :code:`Context.convert_dataset` method has been added
  to enable conversion of any LiberTEM dataset into another
  format on disk. At this time only the numpy binary fomat *.npy* is
  supported, but other formats can later be added according to need
  (:pr:`1379`).
