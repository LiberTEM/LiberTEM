[Feature] JupyterHub and JupyterLab integration
===============================================

* Small changes to make jupyter integration work, and documentation
  on how to set it up (:pr:`1074`)
* Added token-based authentication. For now, it is only usable via
  integrations like jupyter, it will be extended to local/manual usage
  later (:pr:`1074`)
