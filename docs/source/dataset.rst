Dataset
========


Here, we have two simulated 4D-STEM datasets containing diffraction shifting, elliptical distortion, and an r-space/k-space rotational offset.  Two HDF5 files each include the simulated data for two different electron probes: a standard probe, using a circular probe-forming aperture, and a 'bullseye' probe, using a patterned aperture.  Each HDF5 file contains the following data objects:

(a) the 'experimental' 4D-STEM scan of a strained single-crystal gold nanoparticle 

(b) a 4D-STEM scan of a calibration sample of polycrystalline gold 

(c) a stack of diffraction images of the electron probe over vacuum 

(d) a single image of the electron probe over the sample and far from focus, such that the CBED forms a shadow image
