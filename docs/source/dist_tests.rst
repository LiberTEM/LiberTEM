Running distributed tests
=========================

To test the behavior of the distributed parts of LiberTEM, there are now a
few automated test cases available. Because of the distributed nature of the
tests, they need to be run across multiple network nodes (computers, VMs, or
containers). We ship a :code:`docker-compose` configuration to spin up a
scheduler and two workers as separate docker containers.

Requirements
------------

To run the distributed tests, you need to install (a current version of) :code:`docker`
and :code:`docker-compose`. See
`the official docker documentation <https://docs.docker.com/install/>`_ to get started.
To start the test environment, change to the :code:`packaging/docker/` directory and
run the following:

.. code:: shell

   $ docker-compose build
   $ docker-compose up scheduler worker-1 worker-2 ipy-controller ipy-worker-1 ipy-worker-2

Note that you need to run the above command as a user that can access the docker daemon,
for example by being in the :code:`docker` group. The containers are running as long as
the :code:`docker-compose` command is running, so you can stop them using :code:`Ctrl-C`.

You can then run the distributed tests using (from the same directory):

.. code:: shell

   $ docker-compose run --rm tests

As we are running the tests in a docker container, the environment of the `tests` container
will automatically match the environment of the workers.

After changing LiberTEM code, you need to rebuild and restart the containers. Just cancel the first
:code:`docker-compose up` run using CTRL-C and start from the top.

The rebuild should be faster than the initial build, which is accomplished by careful
use of the layer caching feature of docker. This also menas that you may need to update
the :code:`packaging/docker/requirements.txt` file by running the provided
script :code:`update_reqs.sh` when the dependencies of LiberTEM change, or when new
versions of dependencies are released. In CI, this is done automatically.
