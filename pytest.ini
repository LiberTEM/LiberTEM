    dist: tests that exercise the distributed parts of libertem
    with_numba: mark tests that exercise a numba function so we can re-run for coverage
    flaky: mark tests that fail sporadically for unknown reasons so that they can be excluded from release builds
    compilation: mark benchmarks that measure numba compilation time
